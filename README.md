---

The goal of this project is to develop a Big Data application using Spark and its library MLlib in order to predict the arrival delay of commercial fights. This task is not easy and a good amount of structured information is necessary to obtain a good performance. The US Department of Transportation provides all the data regarding the US commercial flights from 1987 to 2008.
